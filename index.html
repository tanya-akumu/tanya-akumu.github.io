<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am an AI researcher and engineer currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Barcelona, where I specialize in AI for medical imaging with a focus on ultrasound technology. My research, funded by a European Research Council grant, aims to develop AI solutions that improve quality healthcare access in low-resource settings.</p> <p>My education includes a BSc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from JKUAT, and a MSc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, where I graduated with a 3.9 GPA and was inducted into the top third of students in the ECE Honor Society. During my Master’s program, I served as Communications Minister on the student council, where I managed stakeholder engagement between students and administration.</p> <p>My professional journey began with embedded hardware engineering for solar home systems at M-Kopa where I designed IoT solutions that brought clean energy to off-grid communities. This experience ignited my passion for using technology to address real-world challenges in sustainability and accessibility.</p> <p>At IBM Research Africa, I did pioneering work in trustworthy AI, developing methods for neural network optimization that achieved significant improvements in memory efficiency. My work contributed to a US patent filing (Patent No. 18384314) and publications in prestigious conferences like IJCAI. My healthcare AI work with the MADIVA hub developed explainable models for predicting multimorbidity in African populations.</p> <p>My technical expertise spans machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and genAI, with proficiency in Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and cloud platforms. I have been recognized for my technical contributions, winning 3rd place out of 144 participants in the MICCAI 2024 ACOUSLIC-AI Challenge and receiving the Outstanding Technical Award from IBM Research.</p> <p>Beyond my technical work, I am passionate about knowledge sharing and advancing diversity in technology. I regularly contribute through invited talks, conference presentations, and panel discussions. I am equally committed to mentoring young women entering tech, helping them navigate career paths and build confidence in STEM.</p> <p>When I’m not immersed in research, I enjoy reading fantasy novels, exploring new countries, or cinema. I believe in the power of stories—whether told through data or literature—to transform our understanding of the world.</p> <p>I am always open to collaborations that leverage AI for positive social impact, particularly in healthcare, sustainability, and accessibility.</p> </body></html>
