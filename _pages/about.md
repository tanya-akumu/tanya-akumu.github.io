I am an AI researcher and engineer currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Barcelona, where I specialize in AI for medical imaging with a focus on ultrasound technology. My research, funded by a European Research Council grant, aims to develop AI solutions that improve quality healthcare access in low-resource settings.

My education includes a BSc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from JKUAT, and a MSc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, where I graduated with a 3.9 GPA and was inducted into the top third of students in the ECE Honor Society. During my Master's program, I served as Communications Minister on the student council, where I managed stakeholder engagement between students and administration.

My professional journey began with embedded hardware engineering for solar home systems at M-Kopa where I designed IoT solutions that brought clean energy to off-grid communities. This experience ignited my passion for using technology to address real-world challenges in sustainability and accessibility.

At IBM Research Africa, I did pioneering work in trustworthy AI, developing methods for neural network optimization that achieved significant improvements in memory efficiency. My work contributed to a US patent filing (Patent No. 18384314) and publications in prestigious conferences like IJCAI. My healthcare AI work with the MADIVA hub developed explainable models for predicting multimorbidity in African populations.

My technical expertise spans machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and genAI, with proficiency in Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and cloud platforms. I have been recognized for my technical contributions, winning 3rd place out of 144 participants in the MICCAI 2024 ACOUSLIC-AI Challenge and receiving the Outstanding Technical Award from IBM Research.

Beyond my technical work, I am passionate about knowledge sharing and advancing diversity in technology. I regularly contribute through invited talks, conference presentations, and panel discussions. I am equally committed to mentoring young women entering tech, helping them navigate career paths and build confidence in STEM.

When I'm not immersed in research, I enjoy reading fantasy novels, exploring new countries, or cinema. I believe in the power of stories—whether told through data or literature—to transform our understanding of the world.

I am always open to collaborations that leverage AI for positive social impact, particularly in healthcare, sustainability, and accessibility.
